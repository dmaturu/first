            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <blockquote>
                The Ideas Program brings LifeSpace’s innovation mission to life by empowering every team member to drive micro-innovations; new, different, and better ways of working that benefit both LifeSpace and the broader industry. It provides a structured platform for submitting ideas that solve problems, improve processes, and enhance the experience for both customers (residents) and team members. By encouraging participation across all levels and locations, the program fosters ownership, recognition, cross-functional collaboration, and a culture of continuous learning.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This initiative embeds a growth mindset into our daily routines, turning everyday observations into practical solutions that improve engagement, capture institutional knowledge, and support our strategic goals. Whether by enhancing the team member experience, driving revenue, or reducing expenses, the Ideas Program helps fuel micro-innovation that contributes to margin expansion and long-term sustainability. Recognizing contributors and celebrating wins builds excitement, energy, and shared accountability, making innovation part of LifeSpace’s DNA.

        </section>

        <section id="framework">
            <h2>Operational Framework</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Program Timeline & Submission Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continuous Submission:</strong> Team members can submit ideas year-round.</li>
                <li><strong>Themed Campaigns (Optional):</strong> Focus on specific topics monthly or quarterly to address priority areas or manage volume.</li>
                <li><strong>One Month and Second Month Post-Launch:</strong> Share an initial summary of ideas submitted and key themes to build momentum.</li>
                <li><strong>Quarterly Evaluation Windows:</strong> Conduct a formal review and prioritization cycle every quarter.</li>
                <li><strong>Quarterly Reflections:</strong> Publish a summary including number of ideas, key themes, success stories, and highlight recognized team members.</li>
                <li><strong>Annual Celebration:</strong> Host a year-end event spotlighting major impacts, success stories, areas for improvement. Celebrating top contributors for visibility and recognition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Idea Evaluation & Implementation Pathways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quarterly Review Panels:</strong> Group and assess ideas each quarter for impact, feasibility, and alignment with strategic goals and moments of truth. (Note: We do have methods to Fast-Track).</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment Path (“Just Do It”):</strong> For simple, low-risk ideas that require minimal resources, encourage team members to act after aligning with their manager, no formal review needed. This approach supports a culture of ownership, responsiveness, and continuous improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast-Track Path:</strong> Expedite high-impact or time-sensitive ideas for immediate review or implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong> Standardize assessment using micro-innovation, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and alignment with company values and strategic pillars.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking & Sharing:</strong> Track all completed ideas (including “just do it” wins), record completion dates, and evaluate for broader rollout.</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict & Sensitive Ideas:</strong> Define a process for handling duplicate/conflicting ideas. Complaints or whistleblowing will be forwarded and flow through appropriate channels in HR and legal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Metrics & Success Measures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of ideas submitted, implemented, and scaled.</li>
                <li>Participation rates across departments, teams, and sites.</li>
                <li>Time from idea submission to decision and implementation.</li>
                <li>Team member and resident engagement, measured through existing pre/post surveys or feedback.</li>
                <li>Visualization of the idea pipeline (intake → triage → review → implement → recognition → scale/share).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Evaluation & Governance Structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> Centralized (Experience team) yet execution is decentralized.</li>
                <li><strong>CX Champions:</strong> Initial review of all ideas at the community level.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation Committee:</strong> Cross-functional team (operations, HR, CX, strategy) filters and prioritizes ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotating Committee Members:</strong> Refresh perspectives by rotating annually or semi-annually.</li>
                <li><strong>Subject Matter Experts:</strong> Consult SMEs as needed for technical or domain-specific input.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Member Voting (Phase II):</strong> Consider team member input through voting for certain categories or finalist ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Validation:</strong> For selected high-impact ideas, gather customer (resident) feedback before implementation.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5. Recognition & Rewards</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize participation, implementation, and measurable impact.</li>
                <li>Rewards may include public shout-outs, leverage Job Pixel, small prizes, and professional development opportunities.</li>
                <li>Celebrate achievements at individual, team, and community levels.</li>
            </ul>
